            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>A New and Profitable Invention, for Drying Malt or Oates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> on a sort of Tyles or Bricks, which far Exceeds those Methods, before in Æ²se among us, in several respects, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> THey are Durable, 'tis probable, for Ages.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> They are safe from the Danger of Fire, which hath proved fatal in many Places.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They Dry with much less Fire (and if required) in shorter time than hath been known before; and 'tis ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, that the Fewel which is saved in a (Well-custom'd) <hi>Kiln,</hi> will in a short time defray the Charge of the <hi>Tyles,</hi> and the expence of <hi>Hair-Cloth</hi> (and straw under it, where it is so used) being both taken off, must make the <hi>Kiln</hi> of much more Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage for the future.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> By raising or lessening the Fire, the <hi>Malt,</hi> &amp;c. may be Dryed hard or slack, and made Pale, or High Coloured, as desired.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The <hi>Malt</hi> and <hi>Meal</hi> dryed thereon, is sweeter, better, and finer Coloured, than that which is otherways Dryed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> One half generally (but never more than two parts in three) of the Ribs or Lats formerly used, are sufficient to support these <hi>Tyles,</hi> which preserve more of the Cummings of the <hi>Malt,</hi> than were saved before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> A piece of a <hi>Kiln</hi> full of <hi>Oats</hi> hath frequently been well Dryed (by the long continuing heat of the said Floor) after the former Corn is taken off, without any addition of Few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, and the Dryster hath less labour than formerly.</p>
            <p>For the sole making, using and vending of the aforesaid <hi>Tyles</hi> or <hi>Bricks,</hi> a <hi>Patent</hi> was lately granted by his Majesty to <hi>John Shallcross</hi> of <hi>Stockport,</hi> in the County of <hi>Chester,</hi> Esq; (and his Assigns) by whose order any Person may be furnished with them; and he is also willing to Contract with, or Depute any Person or Persons, to Make and Sell the said Goods, on such Terms as will tend Considerably to their own Benefit and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, expecting nothing (but in Proportion to, and) until the said Goods shall be sold, to pay the same.</p>
            <p>The said <hi>Tyles</hi> are tryed and approved of, at and about all the Places hereafter named, and are to be Sold at the said Towns, and will in a short time be exposed to Sale in most of the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Towns, in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales.</hi> The Price (excepting Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage) is 3 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d. per</hi> square yard, of flat measure, where Coals are not above 6 <hi>d. per</hi> C. weight.</p>
            <p>From the good Success of the Tryals already made, the Patentee offers, That if the said <hi>Tyles</hi> are (any where) disapproved of, and Returned in a Month's time from the Receiving them, the Price (if Received) shall be Repaid.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:186270:2"/>
            <p>This mark (*) shews what Places (with several Miles round them) are already taken under the <hi>Patentee,</hi> by Persons respectively, to Make and Sell the said Goods within the Compass limitted to them,
